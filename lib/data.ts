export const storyParagraphs = [
  `Born a year before the release of Windows 95, I can't quite pinpoint when my fascination with computers began. It just always seemed to be there. From a young age, I became thoroughly proficient with every legacy OS of that era: Win95, Win98, WinME, Win2000, WinXP, and WinVista. Young as I was, I understood and operated them all at a solid level. Back then, I knew my way around all of it - WinME, which would completely lock up the moment the power so much as flickered, and Windows 2000, whose source code Microsoft eventually made public. Oh, and this is kind of a silly one, but I still remember multiple Win98 serial numbers to this day. Ha. I must have memorized them so young that they're just permanently stuck up there, and can't get rid of them even if I tried.`,

  `If I had to trace the origin of my interest in programming, it would probably be my desire to build something like the MSPaint that came with Win95. My very first programming language was Pascal - primitive by today's standards, a procedural-oriented relic - but it was widely used at the time. For a good while I was completely obsessed with it, spending my days staring at that iconic blue background with white and yellow foreground text on the crt screen.`,

  `From there I explored Visual Basic, Delphi, Flash Script, and various other approaches before finally arriving at C — the true language of programmers. I was 14 years old when I first picked up C/C++. Obviously I wasn't old enough to start a professional career, so I pursued it as a hobby, happily spending my time with C, C++, Windows NT Programming, APIs, MFC, and all manner of libraries. During this period I built apps like a VNC-style remote desktop tool using the Windows API, and gained hands-on experience with threading and asynchronous processing. For someone so young, it was a substantial body of experience.`,

  `After that, I spent a lot of time on Fedora using KDevelop with the Qt library — though I can't recall the exact version. Once I started working professionally, I continued with Qt across Windows and Android, among other platforms. I genuinely enjoyed KDE development as well.`,

  `One thing I remember clearly. I first encountered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ExtJS around 2010. Before that point, nearly all my spare time outside of school was consumed by programming — fingers on the keyboard, always building something.`,

  `My very first assignment as an intern was building Tetris - a competition among new hires to see who could write the shortest, most performant code. That was followed by a project to port two SWF Flash games to Cocos2d.`,

  `During that project, something happened that I'll never forget. A power outage killed the entire office and my machine included. At the exact moment I was pressing Ctrl+S. When the power came back, my main.cpp was gone. Nearly a month of work, wiped clean. Not even a #pragma in sight. Total devastation.`,

  `The company hadn't allowed SVN access for interns' projects, so I'd been working locally with WinRAR as my "version control." Looking back, that's a bit embarrassing to admit — but regardless, that first year at the company was genuinely grueling.`,

  `My next assignment was building an offline dictionary app for architects. Dictionary software turned out to be more complex than expected; only later did I realize corpus theory was at the heart of it. I also developed an application using the Autodesk Revit SDK, which taught me how to work with third-party SDKs.`,

  `Through a personal connection, I moved on to a startup. Understaffed by nature, the company handed two or three simultaneous projects to each developer. That environment pushed me into a wide range of new territory: building internal management systems with ASP.NET, IIS, and Node.js (around v0.4, as I recall); developing a video conferencing system with WebRTC; and building another conferencing client in WinForms.`,

  `And the mobile market was still booming at the time, so I also got extensive experience with Cocos2d and Cocos3d. When CocosCreator completely overhauled the development model in 2019, I stepped away from Cocos entirely - though looking back later, I could see how much easier they'd made things.`,

  `I also spent a long stretch doing hybrid mobile development with Cordova and Ionic, with Framework 7 as my go-to framework. During this period I established a solid understanding of deployment through AWS, and got my first exposure to AngularJS and ReactJS — both of which have evolved enormously since then.`,

  `This company gave me some of the most memorable experiences of my career. I did Android APK reverse engineering and Unity APK reversing. I served as PM on the development of TSolution, an office suite built on top of LibreOffice, where I led the HWP module development and the main UI. The LibreOffice class and module workflow documentation was so extensive that when I printed it out and hung it on the walls, it covered three full walls.`,

  `I also contributed to the KakaoTalk desktop client, led development of a remote internal security management system, built a product sales platform, and — right around the time TensorFlow and Keras were emerging — developed a CAPTCHA auto-recognition and bypass program.`,

  `At my next company, I encountered something I'd never dealt with before: the intersection of software and physical hardware. I'd dabbled with toggling LEDs via assembly and briefly played around with a Raspberry Pi, but this was a different scale entirely. The project involved processing video feeds from 280 Hikvision cameras and using the results to automatically control access gates at the company's main entrance and other locations — opening and closing them based on vehicle authorization. This required not just computer vision, but also PLC integration for motor control. I didn't design the physical PLC boards — hardware engineering isn't my field — but I was responsible for everything on the software side.`,

  `During the COVID period, I also developed an employee attendance and anomaly detection system using thermal imaging cameras.`,

  `Following that, I joined a project comparable in scale to Alibaba + Alipay, where I served as team lead for the payments module and contributed to backend and admin website development for the e-commerce side. The project gave me a much deeper appreciation for the tradeoffs between MongoDB and Oracle DB. We incorporated blockchain concepts into the payment system — not a full multi-node distributed chain in the strict sense, but all transaction signing and payment generation was built with security as a foundation.`,

  `I also led development of a unified management system for restaurants and shopping malls, covering both web and app interfaces. However the POS side wasn't mine. One colleague who loves printing took the side.`,

  `As the Web3 space emerged, I didn't go all-in professionally, but I've kept pace with new Web3 technologies and languages and continue to follow the space today.`,

  `After ChatGPT's arrival in 2022, I worked on several AI-related projects — some of which I can't discuss due to NDAs. Among the ones I can mention: I built a service that lets authors load their books as text files, assign character voices to individual lines of dialogue, and automatically generate a complete audiobook. I also built a service where authors provide chapter and section titles along with basic plot outlines as prompts, and the system auto-completes the entire book.`,

  `Looking back on my career path, I honestly can't quite define what my "specialty" is. But I think that's simply the result of who I am — someone who dives headfirst into any software challenge, whether it pays or not, just because I love it.`,

  `Some people, when they see my résumé or hear me talk about my experience, respond with skepticism — "Is all of this real? How could one person have done all of that?" It's all real. I would never claim experience I don't have, and the things I have done, I remember with precision.`,

  `You, reading this, might be wondering the same thing — "So what exactly is this person's core skill?" Fair question. If I had to pick a few anchors from everything above, I'd say: C#, Windows Programming, and Java (Android).`,

Twice, an accident cut off all contact between me and the person I'd made it to. And yet I never let go of that promise — and neither did he. This is the story of those nine years.`,
          `Nine years ago, I met a client by chance on Upwork. What he'd hired me for was software development. But the real problem he was carrying was something else entirely. He had already spent three years trying to bring this project to life, but the developers he'd worked with either lacked the skill or never truly understood what he was trying to build. All he had to show for those three years were incomplete pieces of work — and not even the source code for those. What remained were a handful of mockup screens he'd sketched himself, and a pile of materials about the marriage and couples-counseling service he ran.`,

          `It took a while to recover. My body eventually healed, but my devices were completely destroyed — every account and every contact stored on them was gone. I've never regretted anything more than not having memorized his contact information. Ten years ago, backing everything up to the cloud wasn't yet the habit it is now.`,

But that's not what this delay was. It was the product of two accidents and a bond that, somehow, refused to break.
